  title={Multi-Objective Design of a Lunar GNSS},
  author={Pereira, Filipe and M. Reed, Patrick and Selva, Daniel },
  abstract={The success of future lunar missions depends on quality positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) information. Earthbound GNSS signals can be received at lunar distances but suffer from poor geometric dilution of precision (GDOP) and provide no coverage of the lunar far side. This article explores the design space of a dedicated GNSS system in lunar orbit by using a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm framework to optimize GDOP, availability, space segment cost, station-keeping ΔV, and robustness to single-satellite failure. Results show that Pareto approximate solutions that achieve a global GDOP availability (GDOP ≤ 6.0) greater than 98\% contain a minimum of 24 satellites in near-circular polar orbits at an altitude of ~2 lunar radii. The impact of single-satellite failure on GDOP outage is analyzed and a no-maneuver scenario is considered. Design rules characterizing optimal solutions are identified and trade-offs between station-keeping maneuver frequency, performance, and design lifetime are discussed.},

  title={Tradespace Analysis of GNSS Space Segment Architectures},
  author={Pereira, Filipe and Selva, Daniel },
  abstract={Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) provide ubiquitous, continuous and reliable positioning, navigation and timing information around the world. However, GNSS space segment design decisions have been based on the precursor Global Positioning System (GPS), which was designed in the 70s. This paper revisits those early design decisions in view of major technological advancements and new GNSS environmental threats. The rich tradespace between User Navigation Error (UNE) performance and constellation deployment costs is explored and conclusions are complemented by sensitivity analysis and association rule mining. This study finds that constellations at an orbit altitude of ~2 Earth radii can outperform existing GNSS in terms of cost, robustness and UNE. These insights should be taken into account when designing future generations of GNSS.},

  title={Analysis of navigation performance with lunar GNSS evolution},
  author={Pereira, Filipe and Selva, Daniel},
  abstract={The gradual expansion of infrastructure on and around the Moon is key to establishing the long-term exploration of the Moon through e.g., NASA’s Artemis and Commercial Lunar Payload service missions. Current missions are largely dependent on the support of the Deep Space Network (DSN) for communication and navigation services at lunar distances. The future increase in demand for these services is likely to be beyond the capabilities of the DSN, which is operating close to capacity. Despite recent work showing that Earthbound Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals can be received at lunar distances, these signals are mostly relevant for time synchronization, since the poor Dilution of Precision (DOP) severely limits their usefulness for precise navigation purposes.In this work, we analyze the navigation performance of two 24-satellite Lunar GNSS constellations. The first architecture was identified in a previous study, using a multi-objective evolutionary optimization framework. It consists of a Walker constellation in near-circular polar orbits at an altitude of ~2 lunar radii that requires modest station-keeping delta-V. The second architecture is based on eccentric repeat ground-track orbits that are shown to have long-term stability and are similar to other architectures proposed in the literature.It is shown that the ISECG absolute positioning goal of 40cm can be achieved by a sub-constellation of architecture 1 with at least 16 satellites if pseudorange and delta range measurements are used.The economic analysis shows that a 16-satellite sub-constellation of architecture 1 can outperform the 24-satellite constellation of architecture 2 while being deployed at a similar cost. an 8-satellite Lunar GNSS constellation would outperform the position accuracy of DSN tracking assuming one 8-hour pass/day. It is estimated that the cost of an 8-satellite Lunar GNSS constellation could be amortized in 15 years by DSN tracking cost savings alone.},

  title={Exploring the Design Space of Lunar GNSS in Frozen Orbit Conditions},
  author={Pereira, Filipe and Selva, Daniel},
  abstract={We have witnessed a growing interest in lunar exploration missions in the last few years, with the announcement of NASA’s Deep Space Gateway, the launch of several uncrewed missions and the involvement of private companies. However, there is currently no reliable means of accurate and instantaneous navigation in the vicinity of the Moon. This poses operational limitations on the autonomy of lunar robotic and small satellite missions. We present the preliminary results of a systems architecture study conducted on a new satellite navigation system
orbiting the moon that would effectively extend the Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) space service volume to cislunar space. A constraint to lunar frozen orbit conditions under
J2, C22 and third-body perturbations is added to achieve stable lunar orbits and the formulation includes the following design decisions: (1) Orbit semi-major axis, (2) Number of satellites, (3)
Number of orbital planes, (4) Satellite phasing in adjacent planes, (5) Orbit eccentricity and (6) Argument of periapsis. The Borg Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm (MOEA) is used to
optimize the satellite constellation design using multiple crossover and mutation operators that can adaptively be selected at runtime. The fitness function takes into account performance, cost,
availability and station-keeping delta-V. The performance metric assessment is based on the Geometric Dilution of Precision (GDOP), which is computed over a grid of 500 equidistant points
on the lunar surface. The input satellite orbits used in the GDOP computation are obtained from high-fidelity orbit propagation using NASA’s General Mission Analysis Toolbox. The space
segment cost model considers satellite constellation development and production costs. Single satellite costs are based on satellite dry mass estimates derived from the power budget analysis
assuming a satellite lifetime of 10 years. The results show that high-performing Lunar GNSS constellation relying on frozen orbits alone can be achieved with 20 satellites but be suboptimal for high-latitude regions.},

  title={Exploring the Design Space of Lunar GNSS in Frozen Orbit Conditions},
  author={Pereira, Filipe and Selva, Daniel},
  abstract={This paper studies the trade-offs between two metrics that play a key role in the design of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)architectures: 
  Dilution Of Precision (DOP)and cost. DOP is a multiplicative factor that quantifies the satellite-user geometric diversity and sets the limit on the achievable User Navigation Error (UNE). 
  We focus on tradeoffs between DOP and cost driven by satellite constellation architecture decisions - e.g., orbit altitude, number of satellites. 
  For simplicity, we restrict the analysis to global constellations resulting in a worst-site Geometric DOP (GDOP)value less than 6. 
  This GDOP value is considered a threshold above which the resulting system would add little value for most GNSS users. 
  The cost metric is subdivided in flight unit production costs based on the satellite dry mass and the learning factor experienced when producing N identical flight units, as well as the launch costs. 
  Satellite dry mass is derived from the estimated payload power required to close the navigation signal link budget at the target received signal power of -155dBW. 
  User navigation error is inferred with the computed GDOP values and a typical GPS pseudorange measurement error budget for dual frequency signal processing. 
  We identified orbit altitude regions of interest that can be used in the design of future GNSS and potentially outperform the current global constellation architectures. 
  In particular, results show that several constellations in “low” Medium Earth Orbits (MEO), - approximately half the orbit altitude of current GNSS constellations- are on the UNE-Cost Pareto front. 
  When compared with the current GPS and GALILEO architectures, these alternatives consist of larger constellations of smaller satellites and have the potential to achieve both better performance and lower costs. 
  Our analysis indicates that Low Earth Orbit (LEO)constellations are significantly more expensive to deploy due to the larger number of satellites required. 
  Finally, we assess the impact of operational costs, launch cost reduction, different end-of-life disposal strategies and transmit power on the overall results.},
